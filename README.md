Wordle is a fun game to play once a day where you have to guess a word, it is always interesting to see if I can get the word right in five guesses.

https://www.geoguessr.com/ 

Geoguessr is a game where you are placed on a random point in the world and you need to try and guess where you are. I am not very good at it but it is fun to see new places and it's a good time waster.
